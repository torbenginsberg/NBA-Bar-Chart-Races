# NBA-Bar-Chart-Races

## Background

Welcome to my NBA Bar Chart Races application! This app is designed for anyone with an interest in fun data visualizations (though NBA fans might get the most out of it!)

First off, a bar chart race -- what is it? A bar chart race is a dynamic take on your traditional bar chart that demonstrates data changing over time by animating the chart. The project leverages data from https://www.basketball-reference.com/ and specifically looks at the 21st century history of the NBA, allowing you to see how the league's players have fared in key statistical categories over the past 20+ years.

## Functionality & MVPs

In NBA Bar Chart Races, users will be able to:

    1. Select the statistic that they want to view the progression of. The first version of the project has the ability to toggle between Points, Rebounds and Assists. More to come in the future!
    2. Set the time range.
    3. Customize the players included in the chart. Select up to 15 players to compare against each other.
    4. Hover over specific bars to see more information about the player.

In addition, this project will include:

    * An instruction pop-up window on the site
    * Search and multiselect functionality for selecting players
    * Ability to reset and create a new chart immediately following completion of the prior chart's progression
