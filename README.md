# NBA-Bar-Chart-Races

## Background

Welcome to my NBA Bar Chart Races application! This app is designed for anyone with an interest in fun data visualizations (though NBA fans might get the most out of it!)

First off, a bar chart race -- what is it? A bar chart race is a dynamic take on your traditional bar chart the demonstrates data changing over time by animating the chart. The project leverages data from https://www.basketball-reference.com/ and specifically looks at the 21st century history of the NBA, allowing you to see how the league's best players have fared in key statistical categories over the past 20+ years.

## Functionality & MVPs

In NBA Bar Chart Races, users will be able to:

    1. Select the statistic that they want to view the progression of. The first (and default) functionality built will be for Points, with additional options coming for Rebounds, Assists, Blocks, Steals, & Win Shares.
    2. See a dynamic visual progression of the top 12 leaders in the statistic from 2000 - 2022. 
    3. Pause and Resume the progression to analyze the graph at a specific point in time
    4. Hover and/or Click on specific bars to see more information about the player

In addition, this project will include:

    * An instruction pop-up window on the site
    * Potentially, the ability to render static charts for each individual season
