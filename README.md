# NBA-Bar-Chart-Races

## Background

Welcome to my NBA Bar Chart Races application! This app is designed for anyone with an interest in fun data visualizations (though NBA fans might get the most out of it!)

First off, a bar chart race -- what is it? A bar chart race is a dynamic take on your traditional bar chart the demonstrates data changing over time by animating the chart. The project leverages data from https://www.basketball-reference.com/ and specifically looks at the 21st century history of the NBA, allowing you to see how the league's best players have fared in key statistical categories over the past 20+ years.

The dynamic chart is powered by the D3 library for JavaScript. As the project progresses, I will provide more detail on specific methodologies moved.
